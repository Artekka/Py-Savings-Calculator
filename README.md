Initial idea from Babasher @ https://github.com/Babasher/SavingsCalculator:
Suppose, we make a program that takes an input from the user;
The amount of money  expected to be made from work (untaxed) every week
The user the inputs number of weeks they are going to work
Each week 15% of the money expected to be made from work
is placed into a savings account each week
